This is intended to be a library, and multiple applications that
share it.  There is therefore no single main.cpp, but rather several
main application files to choose from, depending on what you want
to build:

test.cpp to make sure everything works
stepper_3_arduino.cpp to install on an Arduino board
stepper_3_prototype.cpp to make sure Stepper 3 works
