Improve gate in the sequencer, so notes can last less than the whole time until the next note.  (You won't be able to rely on the gateDuration for this, as it would just turn off then straight back on again.  You probably need a noteDuration instead.)  The sequencer should have at least a global setNoteLength(value) method, if not a note-specific one.
Allow other non-pitch attributes (eg velocity) in the sequencer
Test the attenuator with the gate
Make an envelope genrator; use the attenuator with that instead
Allow slides in the sequencer
Add shuffle/swing to the sequencer
Allow multiple channels in the sequencer
Make a mixer module with panning and stereo output
