Important, low-level stuff:
None.

Nice features:
Implement panning in the mixer module.
Make an ADSR envelope genrator; use the attenuator with that instead.
Make a voltage controlled slew limiter module.  (Basically like the sequencer's slide and the delay module.)
Make a sample and hold module.
Make a voltage controlled delay / echo module.  (With a set sized array, cycled through at a voltage controlled speed, with a voltage controlled amount of feedback and a voltage controlled dry/wet mix.)
Have a go at making a chorus.  (I gather this is something like an extremely short delay with only one copy of the signal and a slightly variable speed.)

Dreams:
A multimode filter would be nice, but is probably beyond my abilities.
A realtime user interface version of the sequencer, that lets you edit rather than passively play notation, with load and save facilities and audio output (even if just sine waves and white noise) would be great, and pave the way for a hardware version of it.
So would a port of this written in C.
