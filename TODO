Important, low-level stuff:

Essential features:
Refactor the code before translating it into C or C++.

Nice features:
I need to improve the README file.
Make an ADSR envelope generator; use the attenuator with that instead.
Make a voltage controlled slew limiter module.  (Basically like the sequencer's slide and the delay module.)
Make a sample and hold module.
Make a voltage controlled delay / echo module.  (With a set sized array, cycled through at a voltage controlled speed, with a voltage controlled amount of feedback and a voltage controlled dry/wet mix.)
Have a go at making a chorus.  (I gather this is something like an extremely short delay with only one copy of the signal and a slightly variable speed.)
Tracker 4 could do with an "export channel to Stepper 1" feature, where whichever channel is currently selected is exported (for all patterns) into a 1-channel-only format compatible with Stepper 1.

Distant dreams:
A multimode filter would be nice, but is probably beyond my abilities.
A realtime user interface version of the sequencer, that lets you edit rather than passively play notation, with load and save facilities and audio output (even if just sine waves and white noise) would be great, and pave the way for a hardware version of it.
A port of this written in C or C++ would be great.  It would not only be faster, but could be integrated with hardware via an Arduino board.
I need to think about whether the software modules should be part of the file format (so songs can include information about which modules are used, and how they're hooked up to the sequencer and each other), or not.  They might work as an extension to the main file format, but the main focus should be on the sequencer, and allowing it to be used with real world synthesisers, not tying it down to a software-only implementation.
Allow the user to change the tempo with each event row.  It works best as a 3-digit int, not as a bipolar control voltage, so it would make more sense to set it within the pattern, in a new kind of non-channel-specific column, than via CV in.
