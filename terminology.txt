Notation is known as the "matrix".
One row of this is a single "event row".
Each item in this is an "event".
An event can either be a note or a rest.
Notes (but not rests) can have an "effect".  (I need to think about whether I really want this to be true.)
All events can (but don't have to) have two control voltages, which have arbitrary uses.
