Notation is known as a song.
The song consists of several patterns.
Each pattern consists of several rows.
Each item in this row is an event (one event per channel).
Each event consist of a twelve tone equal temperament pitch, an optional slide (also known as glide or portamento) effect, a duty cycle / length of the gate relative to the total event row length, and two control voltages, which have arbitrary uses.  By default (if any of these are left unspecified), the pitch is the same as it was in the last row, slide is off, the gate length / duty cycle is the whole of the event row length if there's a slide, half of the event row length if there's no slide but a pitch is specified, or completely off otherwise (in other words, a rest), and the two CV outputs are the same as they were before if no pitch is specified (a rest), or zero if a pitch is specified (a new note).

To avoid confusion, variable names should end in a description of the unit:

...InSeconds (implying that it's a float, allowing finer detail than integral seconds)
...InUnipolarVolts (implying that it's a float in the range of 0 to +5)
...InBipolarVolts (implying that it's a float in the range of -5 to +5)
...InTwelveBits (implying that it's an integer in the range of 0 to 4095)
...InSixtieths (implying that it's an integer in the range of 00 to 60)
...AsDecimal (implying that it's a float in the range of 0 to 1)

For the sake of consistency within a single array, slides are represented in the array as 0 (off) or 60 (on), not as an actual boolean.
